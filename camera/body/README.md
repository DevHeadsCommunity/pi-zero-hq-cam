### Lenses

- 5mm sonew
  - this is the best "all around" lens since it's 27.5mm full frame equivalent
- 12mm arducam
  - this is used as a macro lens
- 35mm arducam
  - narrow due to the 5.5 crop factor
- 8-50mm arducam
  - this works best with the Arducam camera IMX477 camera
  - depending on which adapter is used the lens works better close or far eg. rpi adapter vs. 2 c-cs adapters (hence multiple stl files)

The 8-50mm uses 2 ring adapters (shorter). The other 3 use the RPi HQ Cam ring adapter.
